PORTFOLIO ML RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM - PROBLEM STATEMENT
=====================================================

PROBLEM OVERVIEW:
Develop an intelligent portfolio management system that uses machine learning to provide
personalized investment recommendations based on user preferences and market analysis.

KEY REQUIREMENTS:
1. Multi-model ML comparison using 80/20 train/test split with validation
2. Portfolio-level prediction using all companies' data together
3. Interactive user interface for investment preferences
4. Data-driven recommendations with performance metrics
5. Comprehensive model comparison and selection transparency

TARGET USERS:
Investors like Patrick and Peter Jyengar who need personalized portfolio recommendations:

PATRICK JYENGAR (Conservative Investor):
- Investment Amount: $1,000,000
- Risk Profile: Conservative
- Time Horizon: 5+ years
- Preferred Sectors: Healthcare, Technology
- ESG Preference: Yes
- Expected Outcome: Stable growth with lower volatility

PETER JYENGAR (Aggressive Investor):
- Investment Amount: $1,000,000
- Risk Profile: Aggressive
- Time Horizon: 2-5 years
- Sector Preference: No specific preference (all sectors)
- ESG Preference: No
- Expected Outcome: Maximum returns with higher risk tolerance

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Train and compare 7 regression models:
   - Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression
   - Support Vector Regression (SVR)
   - XGBoost, Random Forest, Bayesian Ridge

2. Use proper time series validation:
   - 80% training data (2015-2019)
   - 20% testing data (2019-2020)
   - Rolling window cross-validation

3. Portfolio-level feature engineering:
   - 89 advanced features from 24 companies
   - Technical indicators (RSI, Bollinger Bands, MACD)
   - Sector analysis and correlations
   - Volume and volatility metrics

4. Interactive recommendation system:
   - User input collection (amount, risk, time horizon, sectors, ESG)
   - Real-time portfolio allocation generation
   - Performance projections and recommendations

5. Model transparency:
   - Complete model comparison tables and visualizations
   - Clear explanation of why the best model was selected
   - Performance metrics and validation results

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
- Identify the best-performing ML model through rigorous comparison
